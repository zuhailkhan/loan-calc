# Google Sign-In Implementation

## What Was Added

Google Sign-In has been successfully integrated into your loan calculator app. Users can now sign in using their Google account in addition to email/password authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/services/firebase.ts`
- Added `GoogleAuthProvider` and `signInWithPopup` imports from Firebase Auth
- Added `signInWithGoogle()` method to `authService` that creates a Google provider and triggers the popup sign-in flow

### 2. Updated `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added `signInWithGoogle` method to the `AuthContextType` interface
- Implemented `signInWithGoogle` function that calls the auth service
- Exposed the method through the context value

### 3. Updated `src/components/AuthPage.tsx`
- Added Google icon SVG component with official Google brand colors
- Added `handleGoogleSignIn` function with proper error handling for popup-related errors
- Added "Sign in with Google" button with divider ("Or continue with")
- Button is styled to match Google's brand guidelines (white background, gray border)

## Firebase Console Setup Required

To enable Google Sign-In, you need to configure it in your Firebase Console:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **Sign-in method**
4. Click on **Google** in the providers list
5. Toggle **Enable**
6. Add your project's public-facing name
7. Add a support email (required)
8. Click **Save**

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" button
2. A popup window opens with Google's sign-in page
3. User selects their Google account and grants permissions
4. Firebase handles the authentication and returns the user credentials
5. User is automatically signed in and redirected to the dashboard

## Error Handling

The implementation handles common Google Sign-In errors:
- Popup closed by user
- Popup blocked by browser
- Account exists with different credential
- Cancelled popup request

## Testing

To test the Google Sign-In:
1. Run `bun dev` to start the development server
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Complete the Google authentication flow
5. You should be signed in and see the dashboard

## Security Notes

- Google Sign-In uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- No passwords are stored in your database for Google users
- Firebase handles all token management and security
- Users authenticated via Google will have their email and profile info available in the `user` object
